### 1. [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/)
Walaupun bisa lewat python atau bahasa lain, testing regex bisa juga dilakukan melalui web ini. Web ini sangat membantu untuk bereksperimen dengan regex.

### 2. [VIM 101](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)
Pengguna VSCode sejati pasti sering mengalami masalah saat menggunakan vim, dan ini adalah jawaban dari masalah-masalah tersebut.

### 3. [Linux File System/Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)
Struktur file di sistem operasi linux bisa jadi membingungkan bagi pemula seperti saya. Kebiasaan menggunakan windows sejak lahir kadang menimbulkan error dan kebingungan saat menggunakannya. Video tersebut dapat membantu menyelesaikan masalah tersebut.

### 4. [Best Linux Distro](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros)
Saat mengetahui terdapat berbagai distro di linux, pasti akan sangat membingungkan bagi orang-orang yang baru mengenalnya. Di laman ini terdapat penjelasan serta kekurangan kelebihan dari beberapa distro yang bisa dicoba untuk pemula.

### 5. [Linux Commands](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/index.htm)
Panik saat QUIZ kemarin? Laman ini dapat menjadi penyelamatnya!

### 6. [File Permissions & Atrributes](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_permissions_and_attributes)
When executing `ls -al`, we will see some random alphabets along with many dashes around them. This kind of thing intrigue me and I ended up in this site which cover this topic pretty clear. It also tells us how to modify those alphabets (which also means modifying file permission).

### 7. [Structures of Directory in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-of-directory-in-operating-system/)
I read this 'Three-Structured Directories' from the course's material but can't find any article about it. I guess there might be typo. Anyway, this short article will give us a better understanding about directory structure in operating system. It also comes with some visualization to give us a clearer picture.

### 8. [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/filesystem-hierarchy-standard)
It's quite frustrating isn't it for us, windows user, when we don't see things like C:, D:, etc. Linux has its own "unusual" directories that can be overwhelming for beginner like me. What makes it more confusing is, they say different Linux distros can have their own unique directory. So here comes a help for us to understand about this Linux filesystem standard.

### 9. [File Allocation Methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-allocation-methods/)
I'm sure we've heard this "contiguous" word when we learn about Linked LIst in the data structure and algorithm class. Now, we will dive deeper about it and this article will be our helper. Again, geeksforgeeks always has a great picture that really helps us, the reader.

### 10. [Directory Implementation](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)
Woah, this one's also related to what we've learned in the data structure and algorithm class. This site explained it concisely and I think it's a good starting point for us to understand more about this topic.

### 11. [File Systems Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV0-EPUYuQc)
I personally don't really understand about this file systems stuff since it works nicely without needing me to know how it works. But here comes this guy who explained what a file system does in just 5 minutes. He also gave some simple comparisons of those file systems for us.

### 12. [Free Space Management](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/free-space-management.aspx)
What this site is trying to tell us about is of course the free space management itself. It's a pretty short article and they use some bullet points to write the advantages and disadvantages of each free space management technique.

### 13. [Little or Big Endian Machine?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)
Remember these words when we're taking the Introduction to Computer Organization class? Yea, Operating System is is the continuation of that class, so we're facing those words again here. I believe some of us might be surprised with the morning pop quiz that asked whether our machine is using Little Endian or Big Endian. So here comes the answer for that!

### 14. [Bit, Byte, Nibble?](https://byte-notes.com/bit-byte-nibble-kilobyte/)
As a programmer, we should know the units we're playing with. These unit mainly tell us about the capacity of some standard data storage system or communication channel. The most commonly used units are the bit and byte. Of course there are so many other units, and you can see it on this site.

### 15. [Memory Management Unit](https://linuxhint.com/swap_memory_linux/)
A memory management unit is a hardware that handles virtual memory and caching operations. It's usually located within the computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU). Want to know more about this MMU? You can check this page.

### 16. [Swap Memory in Linux](https://linuxhint.com/swap_memory_linux/)
When I was setting virtual operating system, there was this swap memory thing that neither I nor my friends do understand. Turns out, swap memory is a very important part of our computer, that is used whenever our RAM runs out of memory. This article written by Karim Budzar will give you a clearer understanding of it.

### 17. [Memory Allocation: First, Best, Worst Fit Allocation Strategy](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_allocation_qa2.htm)
So many strategies about memory allocation out there, even it's more than I can chew. But this webpage gives us a brief explanation about some of them in a nice way. Not only those 3 I mentioned in the title, but it also tells us about Buddy's system and Next fit strategy.

### 18. [Parameter Passing Techniques in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parameter-passing-techniques-in-c-cpp/)
In C, there are different ways in which parameter data is passed into a functions. Some of them that might be familiar to us are passing by value and passing by reference. For those of you who are still confused about the difference between the two, or want to know more about other parameter passing techniques, go check this page.

### 19. [C Pointers](https://iq.opengenus.org/pointers-in-c/)
One of the hardest topics that come when you're learning C is pointers. It's a relatively old concept that doesn't exist in many newer programming languages (as far as I know), or maybe it's just rarely used. I hope this site can help you in understanding pointers with some illustrations they displayed.

### 20. [Logical and Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)
Logical and physical addresses are basically address. So what are the differences between them? Go and find out on this site which I personally think serves the information neatly and makes it easy to understand. It's also really short and comes with some pictures.

### 21. [Page Table](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/page-table-paging-in-operating-system/)
Page table simply is a data structure that maps the page number referenced by the CPU. On this site, you'll learn about the page table itself and its entry. They explained it with some bullets so it'll be easier for us to grasp the information.

### 22. [C in a Nutshell](https://github.com/AGHABEY/Books/blob/master/c-in-a-nutshell-o-reilly-peter-prinz-tony-crawford.pdf)
This week's topic is about C, and I believe that there are already so many sources on the internet that give us information about it. But I have friends who still think that nothing can replace a book. So here is a book about C you can rely on.
